# Contributing to DataSynclabs

## Purpose

DataSynclabs is a decentralized AI coordination system inspired by swarm intelligence.
We prioritize **system integrity, incentives, and coordination logic** over rapid feature development.

This document defines how contributions enter the system.

## Ways to Contribute

### Non-Coding Contributions
- System diagrams
- Documentation improvements
- Threat modeling
- Economic and incentive simulations
- Governance proposals

### Technical Contributions (Later Phase)
- API contracts
- Simulation code
- Coordination logic
- Verification mechanisms

> You do NOT need to code to contribute meaningfully.

## Task Claiming Protocol

1. Choose an open GitHub Issue
2. Comment:  
   `I am claiming this task`
3. You have **72 hours** of exclusivity
4. Post progress updates every 2–3 days
5. If inactive, the task returns to the pool

This mirrors decentralized task locking.

## Review & Validation

All contributions are reviewed against:
- Logical correctness
- System consistency
- Incentive alignment
- Clarity and reproducibility

Approval authority currently resides with the **maintainer (Queen role)**.

---

## Governance & Authority

- Contributors propose
- Maintainer validates
- Discussions handle disagreements
- Issues execute decisions

Governance evolves with system maturity.

---

## What Not to Do

- Do not submit unscoped PRs
- Do not introduce tokens or smart contracts
- Do not redesign core architecture without discussion
- Do not treat this as a freelancing repository

This is infrastructure, not an app.

## Philosophy

Coordination > Code  
Incentives > Features  
Clarity > Speed
