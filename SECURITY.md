# Security Policy — DataSynclabs

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DataSynclabs takes security and incentive integrity seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability affecting:
- Task routing
- Reputation scoring
- Incentive mechanisms
- Model integrity
- Governance logic

please **do not open a public issue**.

### How to Report

Use GitHub’s private security advisory feature:

1. Go to the repository
2. Click **Security**
3. Click **Report a vulnerability**

Alternatively, contact the maintainers via the official communication channel listed in the repository README.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Task lifecycle logic
- Incentive and reputation simulations
- Model pool coordination
- Any future smart contract or automation components

## Disclosure Process

1. Vulnerability is acknowledged within **72 hours**
2. Assessment and mitigation plan is created
3. Fix is implemented or documented
4. Disclosure is coordinated responsibly

## Philosophy

Security at DataSynclabs is not an afterthought.  
It is part of system design.

Coordination systems fail catastrophically when incentives are exploitable.
We treat this as a first-class concern.
