# Tokenomics & Reputation

DataSynclabs uses a hybrid system of virtual tokens and reputation to incentivize contributors.

## Reputation
- Reflects contribution quality
- Increases when tasks are completed successfully
- Decreases for low-effort or incorrect contributions

## Tokens
- Simulate rewards for contributions
- Can be used for governance and special permissions
- Early distribution is based on completed tasks and reputation

## Incentives
- Honest workers gain reputation faster
- Malicious or low-quality behavior is penalized
- System encourages cooperation and adherence to protocols
