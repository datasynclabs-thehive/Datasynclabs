# DataSynclabs Overview

DataSynclabs is a decentralized AI coordination platform inspired by swarm intelligence. It organizes tasks via a Queen AI that coordinates Worker Nodes, forming a distributed system for task allocation, reputation tracking, and incentive distribution.

Key Concepts:
- **Queen AI**: Central decision-making agent.
- **Worker Nodes**: Distributed nodes performing tasks.
- **Task Lifecycle**: Creation → Assignment → Completion → Verification → Reward.
- **Reputation & Incentives**: Mechanisms to ensure honest participation.
